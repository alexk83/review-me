**Code review quiz**

This quiz was designed to give us an understanding of your style of doing code reviews.

Imagine someone from your team just created a pull request with the current code and put you in the list of reviewers.
Take your usual approach to do reviews and leave some comments and suggestions to make the submitted code better.
